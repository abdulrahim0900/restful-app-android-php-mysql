This is a group assignment, each group should be 3-4 members
only. You are requested to develop a complete Android app client and a back-end
MYSQL databases and PHP web services. 



You application domain should be within the academic sector,
such as school, college, education center, etc, ONLY. You can choose any idea
you like, but it has to be in the education.



The following are the main project specifications:



1.       You should have
at least three activities.



2.       You should have
Java entity classes to hold the data (POJO)



3.       You application
should display data retrieved from the back-end in a ListView. So one of your
activities should have a ListView.



4.       Your calls to
the back-end web services should be done using AsyncTask classes.



5.       You application
should allow adding new data, updating existing data, and searching for data.



6.       Your back end
database should be MySql, and the web services should be implemented in PHP.

have data validation before sending it to the back end. you can choose any
combination of data validation you like.



Please Note
the following:



A.       This is a group project,
so make sure you do not share your code with any group under any circumstance.
If similar work is found, students will be sent to disciplinary committee.







B.       I gave you the
freedom to choose app idea you want within education domain, and add the attributes
you want. But no two groups can have similarities in their apps.



C.       At least one of
your detailed activities should be relative layout.



D.      After you finish
developing your project you upload it to GitHub and send the link, and send the
web services files as attachment via Ritaj.



E.       You need to send
UI screen shots of your running app.
